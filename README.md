# BlockRegistrationScheduler.jl

This meta-package has been replaced by individual packages:

- [RegisterDriver](https://github.com/HolyLab/RegisterDriver.jl)
- [RegisterWorkerApertures](https://github.com/HolyLab/RegisterWorkerApertures.jl)
- [RegisterWorkerAperturesMismatch](https://github.com/HolyLab/RegisterWorkerAperturesMismatch.jl)

You can load this as a package, and it will load these others, but generally you should
just use these packages directly.

To get started, see the documentation for [RegisterWorkerApertures](https://github.com/HolyLab/RegisterWorkerApertures.jl).

The old README is available [here](OLD_README.md).
